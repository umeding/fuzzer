**Lexical Conventions**
The basic lexical conventions used by Fuzzer are similar to those in
the Java or C programming language. Fuzzer is a case-sensitive
language. All keywords are in lowercase.

**Whitespace**
White space can contain the characters for blanks, tabs, newlines, and
form feeds. These characters are ignored except when they serve to
separate other tokens. However, blanks and tabs are significant in
strings.

White space characters are :

* Blank spaces
* Tabs
* Carriage returns
* New-line
* Form-feeds
